Using this framework on Cisco's DevNet Sandbox involves setting up the environment to interact with the virtual network devices available on DevNet. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get it done:

### 1. **Access DevNet Sandbox**
   - **Create a Cisco DevNet Account**: If you haven't already, sign up for a free account at [Cisco DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/).
   - **Reserve a Sandbox**: Navigate to the [Cisco DevNet Sandbox Catalog](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Topology) and choose an appropriate sandbox that includes Cisco IOS or IOS-XE devices. For example, you might choose the "IOS XE on CSR Latest" or "Cisco IOS XE on CSR 1000v."
   - **Access Credentials**: After reserving the sandbox, you'll be provided with details like the device IP addresses, SSH credentials, and Ansible-compatible credentials (username/password).

### 2. **Set Up Local Environment**
   - **Install Python and Ansible**: Ensure Python 3.x and Ansible are installed on your local machine.
   - **Clone the Framework Repository**: Clone your project's repository or set up the file structure as described.
   - **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python libraries.

### 3. **Configure the Framework for DevNet Sandbox**
   - **Modify Inventory File**:
     Update the `config/ansible/inventory.yaml` with the IP addresses and credentials provided by DevNet. Example:
     ```yaml
     all:
       hosts:
         csr1000v:
           ansible_host: sandbox-iosxe-latest-1.cisco.com
           ansible_user: developer
           ansible_password: C1sco12345
           ansible_network_os: ios
     ```

   - **Adjust Playbooks**: Ensure the playbooks in `config/ansible/playbooks/` are targeting the correct interfaces and commands appropriate for the devices in the sandbox.

### 4. **Collect Data from DevNet Devices**
   - **Run the Data Collection Script**: Use the `scripts/data_collection.py` script to collect interface and KPI data from the sandbox devices. This will save the output locally.
   - **Example Command**:
     ```bash
     python scripts/data_collection.py
     ```

### 5. **Train the Machine Learning Model**
   - **Prepare Data**: Ensure you have relevant data for training. You may need to manually curate or simulate data based on what you collect from the sandbox.
   - **Run the Training Script**:
     ```bash
     python scripts/ml_model_training.py
     ```
   - **Use Sample Data**: If you don't have enough real data, consider generating synthetic data or using pre-collected datasets.

### 6. **Run the Decision Engine**
   - **Make Adjustments Based on Data**: The decision engine will use the collected data to make real-time decisions and adjust network slices.
   - **Execute Commands**: The `scripts/execute_commands.py` script will apply the required changes to the network devices in the sandbox.
   - **Example Command**:
     ```bash
     python scripts/decision_engine.py
     ```

### 7. **Monitor KPIs**
   - **Start Prometheus Exporter**: Run the Prometheus exporter to expose the KPI metrics on an HTTP endpoint. This can be accessed locally or by Prometheus for monitoring.
   - **Example Command**:
     ```bash
     python monitoring/prometheus_exporter.py
     ```
   - **Access the Metrics**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/metrics` to view the KPI metrics.

### 8. **Testing the Framework**
   - **Run Unit Tests**: Ensure that your framework is functioning correctly by running the unit tests in the `tests/` directory.
   - **Example Command**:
     ```bash
     pytest tests/
     ```

### 9. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline (Optional)**
   - If you’re working on a larger project, consider integrating this framework into a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI to automate testing and deployment.

### 10. **Documentation and Support**
   - **Follow Cisco's Documentation**: Cisco provides detailed API and CLI documentation for their devices, which can be useful for customizing your playbooks and scripts.
   - **DevNet Learning Labs**: Utilize Cisco’s [DevNet Learning Labs](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/labs/) for tutorials and examples that can enhance your automation framework.

### Additional Considerations
- **Sandbox Constraints**: Remember that DevNet Sandboxes have resource limits, so be cautious with the intensity of your automation scripts.
- **Session Expiration**: Sandboxes are temporary. Make sure to save your work and data before the sandbox session expires.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully use your automation framework with Cisco’s DevNet Sandbox to implement self-adjusting network slicing.
